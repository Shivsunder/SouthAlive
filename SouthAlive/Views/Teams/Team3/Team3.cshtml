        <h4><b>What we are up to:</b></h4>
        <br />
        <h5><b>Convenor:</b> Peggy Peek</h5>
        <h5><b>Email:</b> peggypeek@gmail.com</h5>
        <h5><b>Telephone:</b> 216 2365</h5>

        <h5>Purpose:</h5>
        <p>To facilitate and sponsor projects at a more local, neighbourhood level to help neighbours establish and strengthen relationships with each other, thus increasing community health, happiness and resilience</p>
        <br />
        <h5>What have we done?</h5>
        <p><b><i>Neighbourhood Project Fund</i></b></p>
        <p>A fund which gives up to $1000 to groups or individuals for community projects, where the group matches that amount in-kind (labour, donations of products or services etc). So far funded three projects have been funded:</p>
        <ul class="browser-default">
            <li>New River School - walkway upgrade to Kew Road</li>
            <li>A church to establish a community vegetable garden</li>
            <li>Sport Southland to run a 10 week fitness programme at the Community Park Gym</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h5><b>Forward plans</b></h5>
        <p><i>Over the Fence</i></p>
        <p>The idea for this project is to help neighbours meet each other by providing some financial assistance for the hosting neighbour(s) to have a morning or afternoon tea, bbq etc – which could be at one neighbours house, or the nearest park etc. There are also some materials to go with that e.g. sample invitations and guides on what to do.</p>
        <p>However, the project needs some new volunteers to take it up and make it happen. Let us know if you might be interested in working with others on this.</p>
